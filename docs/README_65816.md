# Guide for Emulating the 65816 Processor

This document outlines the steps and recommendations for creating a file similar to `cpu_6502.c` but designed to emulate a 65816 processor. It follows the same philosophy of cycle-based emulation, adapting it to the specific features and improvements of the 65816 architecture.

---

## 1. Analyze the Differences and Similarities

- **Compatibility and Operating Modes:**  
  The 65816 is an extension of the 6502 and includes:
  - **Emulation Mode:** Similar to the 6502.
  - **Native Mode:** Uses 16-bit registers (such as the accumulator and, in some cases, the index registers).  
  Additionally, it introduces new registers such as:
  - **Direct Page (DP)**
  - **Data Bank (DB)**
  - **Program Bank (PB)**

- **Address Space:**  
  While the 6502 operates with a 16-bit address bus, the 65816 uses a 24-bit address bus. This affects the implementation of memory access routines and internal address representation.

- **Cycles and Synchronization:**  
  Like the 6502, the 65816 can be emulated using a cycle-based approach (dividing each cycle into phases like `CYCLE_BEGIN`, `CYCLE_MIDDLE`, and `CYCLE_END`). However, the number of cycles and behaviors will vary depending on the 65816 instructions and potential page crossings.

## 2. Definition of Data Structures and Pins

- **Internal Structure:**  
  Create a structure similar to `Cpu6502_private` but extended to include all registers of the 65816. For example:
  - **Data Registers:**  
    - Accumulator (A): In native mode, 16-bit; in emulation mode, 8-bit.
    - Index Registers (X and Y)
    - Stack Pointer (SP)
    - Program Counter (PC) with 24-bit addressing (stored in a 32-bit variable).
  - **Additional Registers:**  
    - Direct Page (DP)
    - Data Bank (DB)
    - Program Bank (PB)
  - **Processor Flags:**  
    Some flags may have different behaviors, especially regarding decimal mode or register width.

- **Definition of Pins and Signals:**  
  Define a table similar to `Cpu6502_PinTypes` for the 65816 (e.g., `Cpu65816_PinTypes`), specifying address, data, control (reset, IRQ, NMI, etc.), and clock pins. Depending on the simulator, additional signals may be required to handle the 24-bit bus.

## 3. Implementation of Memory Access and Cycle Management Functions

- **Fetch and Store Functions:**  
  Reuse the idea of functions like `fetch_memory()` and `store_memory()`, adapting them for 24-bit addressing and new addressing modes.

- **Cycle Phase Division:**  
  Implement a function similar to `cpu_6502_execute_phase()` (e.g., `cpu_65816_execute_phase()`) that:
  - Reads bus signals.
  - Sets address and data outputs.
  - Updates CPU state and manages interrupts if necessary.

- **Handling Extended Cycles:**  
  Some 65816 instructions require additional cycles (e.g., in native mode operations or page crossings). Ensure that instruction decoding functions account for these extra cycles.

---

## 4. Instruction Decoder Design

- **Separation by Instructions and Addressing Modes:**  
  Follow the same approach as in `cpu_6502.c`:
  - Create functions like `decode_adc()`, `decode_and()`, etc., adapted to 65816 semantics (considering, for example, whether the accumulator is in 8-bit or 16-bit mode or if decimal mode is active).
  - Include legacy instructions (for emulation mode) and 65816-specific instructions (for native mode).

- **Auxiliary Functions for Fetching Operands and Addresses:**  
  Develop versions of functions like `fetch_address()` and `fetch_operand()` that correctly handle the extended address bus and new addressing modes (e.g., banked modes or Direct Page offsets).

- **Flag Updates:**  
  You can reuse macros or functions (such as `CPU_CHANGE_FLAG()`) to update flags, but verify if adjustments are needed for new modes or data sizes.

---

## 5. Interrupt Handling and CPU States

- **Interrupts and Reset:**  
  Adapt the interrupt sequence (IRQ, NMI, and BRK) for the 65816, considering interrupt vectors and possible mode switches (emulation vs. native).

- **CPU States:**  
  Implement a state machine similar to the 6502 (e.g., states like `CS_INIT`, `CS_RUNNING`, `CS_IN_IRQ`, `CS_IN_NMI`) and include additional states if needed to manage mode changes or special conditions.

---

## 6. Integration into the Simulator

- **Interface Functions:**  
  As with the 6502, define creation, destruction, and processing functions, such as:
  - `Cpu65816 *cpu_65816_create(Simulator *sim, Cpu65816Signals signals);`
  - `static void cpu_65816_process(Cpu65816 *cpu);`
  - `static void cpu_65816_destroy(Cpu65816 *cpu);`

- **Signal Groups:**  
  Configure signal groups for the address and data bus using macros and functions similar to `SIGNAL_DEFINE_GROUP()` and `SIGNAL_WRITE()`, adapting them to the 65816's bus width and pin count.

## 8. Testing and Validation

- **Documentation:**
  Refer to the official 65816 documentation and specialized tutorials.

- **Tests:**
  Create test programs to verify behavior in both emulation and native modes, ensuring proper updates of registers and flags.
